Welcome to pyshepseg's documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
------------
Python implementation of image segmentation algorithm of 
Shepherd et al (2019). Operational Large-Scale Segmentation of Imagery Based on Iterative 
Elimination. `Remote Sensing 11(6) <https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/6/658>`_.

This package is a tool for Python programmers to implement the segmentation algorithm. 
It is not a stand-alone solution for people with no Python experience.

We thank the authors of the paper for their algorithm. This implementation was created 
independently of them, and they are in no way to blame for any mistakes we have made.
